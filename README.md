🎭 Instagram AI Deepfake Detector 🔍
Hackathon Submission Project

A full-stack AI system that detects deepfake videos, AI-generated media, and coordinated bot amplification campaigns on social media using behavioral analytics and machine learning.

🧩 Problem Statement

Social media platforms face a rapid rise in:

AI-generated deepfake videos

Synthetic influencer content

Coordinated bot amplification

Fake advertisements & scam campaigns

These threats manipulate public opinion, spread misinformation, and damage platform trust.

Current detection systems focus only on pixel-level media forensics, ignoring behavioral interaction signals.

💡 Our Solution

We built an AI-powered detection platform that combines:

Behavioral interaction analytics

Graph network analysis

Entropy & synchronization modeling

AI content risk scoring

All wrapped inside a fully functional Instagram-style interface for real-world simulation.

🚀 Key Innovations

Detects deepfakes without needing raw video training datasets

Uses interaction behavior instead of visual artifacts

Identifies coordinated campaigns in real time

Works on ads, reels, and feed posts

Provides explainable AI signals

🧠 Detection Methodology

Our engine analyzes 6 behavioral signals:

Spread Speed Analysis
Detects abnormally rapid engagement spikes

Early Burst Detection
Flags concentrated interactions immediately after posting

Synchronization Analysis
Finds coordinated actions within 2-second windows

User Diversity Score
Measures ratio of unique users vs interactions

Behavioral Entropy
Evaluates randomness in engagement timing

Graph Clustering
Detects densely connected bot networks
